# Project Name
ANALYSIS OF PROTEIN SECONDARY STRUCTURE PREDICTION USING ALPHAFOLD DEEP LEARNING MODEL 

## Description
This is my Undergraduate thesis source code repository. It's basically analyzing AlphaFold3's ability in Protein Secondary Structure Prediction (PSSP). 
This repository is a copy of the original code used in the paper SADGRU-SS (see reference), hence the nameðŸ˜….

## Features
- Converter from macromollecular Crystallographic Information (mmCIF) to Secondary Structure.
- Protein secondary structure datasets used: CB513, CASP14, TS115

## Usage
- This repo is currently used merely as codebase without a clear intention for others usage.
