# Project Name
SADGRU-SS

## Description
This is my Undergraduate thesis source code. My thesis is about Protein Secondary Structure Prediction (PSSP). 
This project is inspired from my lecturer's research.
SADGRU-SS, is the name of Deep Learning model used on the previous research.

## Features
- I tried implementing a converter to convert protein tertiary structure to secondary using Define Secondary Structure Protein (DSSP) package.
- It uses BioPython library as a wrapper for DSSP.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/4gungnand/SADGRU-SS.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash

   ```
3. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
